### Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a Coca Cola retail sales dataset from the United States using Microsoft Excel. I began by cleaning the raw data so it was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Once the data was clean, I explored sales trends across different products, regions, and time periods to understand what was really driving performance. I then brought the insights to life by building simple and interactive visualizations and a dashboard that make the results easy to understand. This project shows my approach to turning messy data into clear insights that can support smarter business decisions.

### Data Sources

The dataset used in this project was obtained from a publicly shared tutorial by the YouTube channel KenjiExplains. The data was provided strictly for learning and practice purposes and represents a simulated Coca-Cola retail sales dataset for the United States. It was used to practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques in Microsoft Excel and does not represent official or confidential company data.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Data cleaning, analysis and visualization) [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
  
### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial data cleaning/preparation, I perfomred the following tasks;
1. I reviewed the dataset "CSV FILE", to understand the structure and meaning of each column.
2. I handled missing values where necessary.
3. I corrected inconsistent text entries and standardized product and region names.
4. I formatted dates and numerical values to ensure accurate calculations in Excel.
5. I organized the data into a clean and structured format ready for analysis and visualization.

### Explanatory Data Analysis

After cleaning the data, I explored it to understand trends and patterns in Coca Cola sales across the United States. I looked at how different Beverage brands were performing, which regions and Retail had higher sales, and how sales changed over time. I calculated totals, averages, and percentages to get a clear picture of performance. This step helped me uncover insights, spot interesting patterns, and figure out what to highlight in the visualizations and dashboard. It was all about making sense of the numbers and finding the story behind the data.



### Data Analysis

I explored the cleaned dataset to uncover meaningful insights using Excel. Some of the key features and formulas I used include:
- SUMIFS and COUNTIFS to calculate total sales and counts based on multiple conditions like Beverage brand, region and Retail.
- Pivot Tables to summarize sales data quickly and spot trends across Beverage brands, Retails and regions.
- Conditional Formatting to highlight high and low sales numbers for easy visual understanding.
- Charts and Graphs like column and line to visualize sales patterns and trends over time in the regions.


### Results

The Analysis results are summerized as follows;
- The Company's sales took a significant increase from 2022 to 2023, with a noticeable peak during the third quarter of 2023.
- Coca-Cola is the best Beverage brand and Fizzy-Co is the best Retailer that improved among others in 2023 compared to 2022.
- The West region has the most Total sales.

### Recommendations 

Based on the analysis, here are some recommendations;
- Since sales peaked in the third quarter of 2023, the company could plan marketing campaigns or promotions around that period to maximize revenue.
- Coca-Cola being the top-performing beverage brand shows strong market preference. The company could focus on expanding its product availability and promotions for Coca-Cola while investing in marketing and promotion to boost other underperforming brands.
- Fizzy-Co stood out as the best retailer in 2023. Other Retailers building stronger partnerships with Fizzy-Co and analyzing what worked well for them could help them in achieving similar success.
- Targeted campaigns, promotions, or increased distribution in the west region could help sustain growth while also exploring ways to boost sales in other regions.
